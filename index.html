    Imagine you want to make a map of your backyard so you can play games and know where everything is. A Land Surveyor is someone who makes maps of big places, like parks and neighborhoods. 
    <br/><br/>
    They use special tools, kind of like a magic ruler, to measure the land and see how big everything is. Then, they draw pictures of the land so everyone can see where things are and how far apart they are.
    <br/><br/>
    So, a Land Surveyor helps make sure we know where everything is on the land, just like your map helps you know where to play in your backyard!

                  <h1>Understanding the Role of a Land Surveyor</h1>
<p>
    Picture this: you’ve got a backyard, and you’re ready to build the coolest treehouse ever. But wait, where exactly does your yard end, and your neighbor’s begin? Enter the <strong>land surveyor</strong>, the Sherlock Holmes of the land world. Their mission? To crack the case of the mysterious property lines.
</p>
<p>
    Armed with high-tech gadgets like GPS devices and laser measuring tools, these land detectives map out your territory with the precision of a ninja slicing through a watermelon. It might not sound thrilling, but trust me, it’s crucial. Imagine building your dream treehouse only to find out it’s half on your neighbor’s lawn – awkward!
</p>
<p>
    But land surveyors don’t just stop at backyards. They’re the unsung heroes behind massive projects like highways, bridges, and entire cities. They make sure everything fits perfectly on the land like a well-played game of Tetris. Without them, our world would be a chaotic mess of mismatched property lines and squabbling neighbors.
</p>
<p>
    So, in a nutshell, land surveyors are the behind-the-scenes champions who make sure everyone knows exactly where their land starts and stops. They prevent future property disputes and ensure that construction projects run smoothly. Basically, they keep the peace and order in the world of land ownership and development!

    <p>
        Imagine the world of land surveying as a grand exploration of boundaries and dimensions, a timeless quest to understand and delineate the spaces we inhabit. Land Surveyors are the modern-day philosophers of this spatial realm, using their tools to uncover the truths of the land.
    </p>

    <p>
        Just as philosophers seek to define the abstract boundaries of thought and existence, Land Surveyors seek to define the physical boundaries of our world. They employ a variety of instruments, from GPS devices to theodolites, to measure and map the earth's surface with precision and accuracy. These measurements serve as the foundation for all manner of human endeavors, from constructing buildings to resolving property disputes.
    </p>

    <p>
        The work of a Land Surveyor is governed by the principles of geometry and geography, much like how philosophical discourse is governed by logic and reason. Their findings are meticulously documented and serve as the basis for legal descriptions and construction blueprints. In this way, Land Surveyors ensure that the physical world is as ordered and comprehensible as the world of ideas.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unlike the ephemeral nature of philosophical debates, the work of a Land Surveyor has tangible, lasting impacts. Their maps and surveys are relied upon by architects, engineers, and urban planners to shape the landscapes of our cities and communities. Through their precise measurements, they bring clarity and order to the complex tapestry of land ownership and development.

                    <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/6lgf0l/vitalik_drops_the_mic_on_rbtc/dju1y8q/" target="blank">Vitalik Buterin (one of Ethereum's creators) acknoweledges Ethereum has looming issues</a> which need to be solved:</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Scalability sucks; the blockchain design fundamentally relies on bottlenecks where individual nodes must process every single transaction in the entire network</li>
                            <li>PoW is extremely expensive, and furthermore is fundamentally vulnerable to 51% spawn camping attacks with no effective strategy for recovering from one. Selfish mining is profitable starting at 25-33% hashpower, and 51% censorship attacks are definitely profitable.</li>
                            <li>Privacy sucks</li>
                            <li>It's hard for regular users to hold large amounts of funds without running substantial risks of theft or loss due to theft or loss of their private keys.</li>
                            <li>Economics do not encourage good "storage hygiene"; insufficient incentives for clearing storage and insufficient cost for filling it, especially for long periods of time</li>
                            <li>Bunch of various marginal technical inefficiencies.</li>
