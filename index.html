            A Land Surveyor is like a special group of people who use their tools to measure and draw pictures of land. These tools help them talk to each other's computers, so they can work together on important jobs that need lots of brainpower.
            <br/><br/>
            If someone wants to use the tools for a big job that takes a while, they have to give the computers some special coins called "Surveyor Coins."

<div id="skeptic" class="hidden">
    <h2>A mysterious world of land measurement, why not?</h2>

    <p>Why would someone think about using Land Surveying for questionable things? Well, because it's a realm without strict rules: no clear guidelines, no safeguards, and large enough that you can do things without being noticed.</p>

    <h2>Dubious Schemes</h2>
    <p>So, first off, let's talk about dubious schemes. Land Surveyors use advanced tools that let you set up tricky plans that can keep running without anyone overseeing them. These plans can go on forever.
    <br/><br/>
    Some researchers dug deep into this area and found <a href="https://example.com/research-paper.pdf" target="blank">extensive research</a> to identify, classify, and examine dubious schemes involving Land Surveying. To put it simply: those involved in these schemes knew what they were getting into.</p>

    <p>From the research:</p>
    <blockquote>
        However, there's a chance that as Land Surveying becomes more popular and gets used for different purposes, people might misuse it for their shady plans. Besides the growth of traditional dubious schemes, we could see a new wave of schemes that are harder to recognize, blending different activities to create complex plans that are difficult to distinguish as dubious schemes or legitimate projects.
        <br/><br/>
        Our analysis suggests that there's still time to come up with proper guidelines, and this offers an initial understanding of the challenges that need attention.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Land Coin Offerings</h2>
    <p>
        A Land Coin Offering, or LCO, is a way for anyone to raise money using Land Surveying. They would simply make a website explaining what problem they want to solve, and then they list their LCO on websites like <a href="https://www.lco-list.com/" target="blank">this one</a> or <a href="https://www.coinschedule.com/" target="blank">that one</a>.
        <br/><br/>
        As of a certain date, I'm going to put LCOs here because there's not enough accountability in the community regarding two important things:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Telling the truth about what they plan to do.</li>
        <li>Taking responsibility for their actions.</li>
        <li>Avoiding hype tactics, like setting specific start and end times for LCOs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Essentially, many rules in well-established fields were created for good reasons. Not having these rules can lead to unsafe actions.

                    <h1>Understanding the Role of a Land Surveyor</h1>
  <p>
    Imagine you own a piece of land, like your backyard. A <strong>land surveyor</strong> is someone who's like a detective for land. Their job is to figure out exactly where your land starts and ends, like drawing a map that shows all the boundaries and corners.
  </p>
  <p>
    They use special tools like GPS devices and measuring equipment to make sure everything is accurate. This might not sound too exciting, but it's super important. See, when you want to build something new on your land, like a fence, a house, or a shed, you need to know exactly where your land ends so you don't accidentally build on your neighbor's property.
  </p>
  <p>
    Land surveyors also help with big projects like roads, bridges, and cities. They help design and plan these things so they fit properly on the land and follow the rules. Without them, things could get messy, and people might end up arguing about property lines and who owns what.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, in a nutshell, a land surveyor helps make sure that everyone knows where their land begins and ends, preventing problems and misunderstandings in the future. They're like the behind-the-scenes heroes of property ownership and construction!
  </p>

                    <h2>So what, why do people care about Ethereum so much?</h2>
                    <p>
                    If you've heard about Ethereum it's probably for one of two reasons:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Speculative investing</b> - because you can buy Ether at places called <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/528aa14afba5fe38a6000042" target="blank">exchanges</a> and more and more people are buying Ether, less of it is available and so the price is rising. However, like buying stocks in the stock market where companies can have ups and downs, Ethereum could experience this too, and the Ether people buy could lose value very rapidly.</li>
                        <li><b>Technological excitement</b> - many people are excited about Ethereum because, much in the same way that the internet changed how everyone communicates, Ethereum has the potential to change how much of the world exchanges money, and organizes around trust.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Ok, so should I do anything about it?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Probably not right now, unless you're pretty nerdy or you're <a href="index.html#investor">a savvy investor<a/> (and have money to lose). Ethereum is too new a technology to worry about.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Raising Money on Ethereum Blockchain</h2>

                    <p>
                        So, elsewhere on this website I mention that ICOs are potentially scammy vehicles for unscrupulous fundraising. Conversely, token offerings can be used by companies that are indeed legitimate in order to raise money for their projects. Ethereum initially raised money to start the project itself using Bitcoin, and has gone on to build off the smart contract system intrinsic in it's own platform to <a target="blank" href="https://www.ethereum.org/token">allow anyone to create a token</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Wait, What are Tokens Exactly?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Tokens are a digital asset (specific to a particular project/company) that can be used like a currency, built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. In order to acquire a particular token you would exchange ETH for that token. Different tokens may have different contracts though, so not all tokens are created equally, but generally in an ICO tokens are being used like stocks, allowing you to own a portion of a company in exchange for ETH. The value of the token changes based on demand for that particular token, and you can convert your holdings of a certain token back to ETH by selling it on <a target="blank" href="https://poloniex.com/exchange#btc_eth">an exchange that lists ETH tokens</a> (or in person).
                        If you want to know more I highly recommend <a target="blank" href="https://blog.coinbase.com/a-beginners-guide-to-ethereum-tokens-fbd5611fe30b">this blog post</a> written by <a href="https://medium.com/@linda.xie">Linda Xie.</a>

                            Imagine the Ethereum Network like a giant, global dispensary and farmer's co-op that nobody owns. Instead, members of the network pitch in the occasional bud (computer resources) when someone about to have a much bigger party (C++ developers, wizards, etc.) needs to borrow from the stash. These "parties" could be all kinds of things from distributed movie renderings to web applications.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Unlike bumming your friend smokes, however, or central banks, user of your "bud" is backed by "smart contracts" which ensure that participants of the Ethereum Network are compensated even if the party really sucked. This means more parties, bigger parties and better yet, parties which can't leave everyone broke.

                    <h2>Investing in Ethereum</h2>

                    <p>
                        <i>This section is being authored by Joshua Goldbard, Kevin Fischer, and Apneet Jolly founders of Crypto Lotus LLC, General Partner of a crypto hedge fund <a href="www.cryptolotus.com">www.cryptolotus.com</a>. This is not financial advice. Cryptocurrency is a high-risk asset class with extreme volatility.</i>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Broadly speaking, Ethereum is coal. Users burn Ethereum to run a piece of software called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (VM). Like most machines, the Ethereum VM consumes a resource to perform an operation. In Ethereum, we call this resource gas, and we use it to operate the Ethereum VM. Users must buy gas every time they want to perform an operation (though many systems hide this action from the user). The way you buy gas is by converting tokens. So what kinda stuff can the Ethereum VM do?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Ethereum VM runs programs. A program is a set of instructions. These instructions could be "move 10 ethereum tokens from this address to this address" or they could be "move 20 ethereum tokens from this address to this address when I send a message". As one can imagine these things can get very complicated, but the basic point is this: Users spend ether to execute programs which mostly relate to moving ether from one place to another. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>So why does this matter?</h3>

                    <p>
                        Before Ethereum, we had to both trust a 3rd party to execute a contract. That could be a notary-public, a lawyer, a bank, a regulatory body, etc. That trusted 3rd party would of course charge a fee or tax for their role in ensuring the proper execution of the contract, e.g. running the set of instructions. Ethereum offers all the power of a contract over the internet, using technology to automate what trusted 3rd parties have historically offered. The gas charge is similar to the fee we used to pay to 3rd parties and is what keeps the whole ecosystem going.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Whether or not to invest in Ethereum boils down to three main macro risks:</h3>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Regulatory: Governments outlaw Ethereum or enact regulations that make its use impractical.</li>
                        <li>Security: Attackers threaten the integrity/availability of the Ethereum network and its transactions.</li>
                        <li>Adoption: Does Ethereum beat out traditional pen and paper contracts? Is there another technology that has wider appeal?</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        I am not going to try to convince you Ethereum is secure, no software really ever is, but I can say that it looks like the Ethereum team is taking the problem of security seriously. I'm also not going to try to convince you that I know the future of regulatory proclamations. I can say it looks like things are pretty chill at the moment, but we all should know the past does not predict the future. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As for adoption, I will now pose a potential narrative of Ethereum's future. Please note that this is a forward-looking statement and I am not an oracle. This is a story of one possible future of Ethereum.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a revolutionary technology bringing automation to the contract universe, Ethereum will earn a growing share of the total market for "contracts." I think it's pretty easy to say that the business of "contracts" is bigger than the current market capitalization of Ethereum. For example, in 2016 JP Morgan alone earned $96B of revenues. Compare that with Ethereum's total market cap of $22.5B USD (as of 7/10/2017, <a href="http://coinmarketcap.com">coinmarketcap.com</a>) and the potential becomes pretty obvious. 
                    </p>

                    <p>So there you have it: Ethereum is digital coal and it may or may not be valuable.</p>
